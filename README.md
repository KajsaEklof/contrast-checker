# Colour Contrast Checker App

This project was inspired by [this colour contrast checker extension](https://github.com/Pushedskydiver/Colour-Contrast-Checker).

I'm tired of copy and pasting each theme colour one by one when I create apps so I wanted to be able to check my whole theme at once. That's why I added the theme checker section in this project. I'm hoping to improve the project so that you can edit and save your theme colours.
